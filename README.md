styleNinja.js
============

A versatile script to apply any CSS styling to non-english based characters / text.

||| Note: 
- Currently works for text containing in 'p', 'a' and 'span' tags. Requires workaround for 'div' since there are known issues.
- This script is at its very flux state. Requires improvements, but serves the purpose as of now.

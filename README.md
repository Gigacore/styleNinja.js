styleNinja.js
============

A versatile script to apply any CSS styling to non-english based characters / text.

##Note: 
- Currently works for text containing in `a` `p` `li` `span` `strong` `em` `td` `tr` `th` `h1` `h2` `h3` `h4` `h5` `h6` `label` `option` `select` tags. Might require bit of workarounds for `div` only if no ID or Class is specified.
- This script is at its very flux state. Requires improvements, but serves the purpose as of now.
